## Why General Skills? 🎯

Mastering these foundational skills is crucial because:

- They help you navigate and manipulate files on any system  
- They introduce secure remote access protocols like SSH  
- They teach you how to interact with network services using netcat  
- They familiarize you with data formats, encodings, and conversions  

Building a strong base here will make tackling more advanced CTF challenges much easier.
