# 2Warm Challenge üå°Ô∏è

## Challenge Description
This challenge tests your ability to convert numbers between different number systems ‚Äî specifically from hexadecimal to decimal. Understanding number systems is fundamental in cybersecurity for analyzing memory addresses, encoding, and data representation.

---

## Prerequisites
To solve this challenge, you should be familiar with:

- Number systems: hexadecimal (base 16) and decimal (base 10)  
- Basic command-line usage  
- Simple arithmetic operations in the shell or Python

---

## Tools Used
- Terminal or command prompt  
- `bash` shell (Linux/macOS) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)  
- Optional: Python interpreter for number conversions

---

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Understand the problem
You are given a hexadecimal number (e.g., `0x3E8`) and need to convert it to its decimal equivalent.

### Step 2: Use bash shell arithmetic expansion
You can use the shell‚Äôs built-in arithmetic expansion to convert hex to decimal:

```bash
echo $((0x3E8))
````

This command tells the shell to evaluate `0x3E8` as a hexadecimal number and output the decimal value.

### Step 3: Alternatively, use Python

If you prefer Python, you can convert hex to decimal with:

```python
print(int("0x3E8", 16))
```

This parses the string `"0x3E8"` as base 16 and prints the decimal value.

### Step 4: Find the flag

The decimal conversion gives you the numeric answer needed to get the flag, often included in the challenge description or revealed after submitting this value.

## Explanation

Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system used widely in computing. Each digit represents values 0‚Äì15, with letters A-F representing 10‚Äì15. Converting to decimal helps interpret these values in standard base-10.

For example:

* `0x3E8` in hex = `3 * 16¬≤ + 14 * 16¬π + 8 * 16‚Å∞`
* Calculated as `3*256 + 14*16 + 8 = 768 + 224 + 8 = 1000` decimal.

## Summary

This challenge is a simple but important exercise in understanding and converting number systems, a skill you will frequently use in cybersecurity challenges and real-world tasks.
