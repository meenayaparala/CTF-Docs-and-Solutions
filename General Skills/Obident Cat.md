# Obedient Cat Challenge üê±

## Challenge Description
In this challenge, you are tasked with reading the contents of a file to find the hidden flag. It‚Äôs designed to teach you how to use basic command-line tools to access and view files ‚Äî a fundamental skill in cybersecurity and system exploration.

The challenge folder contains a file with the flag inside. Your job is to find and read that file.

---

## Why This Challenge Matters
In real-world cybersecurity, you often need to explore file systems to locate sensitive information or configuration details. Knowing how to quickly view file contents using command-line tools is essential for:

- Investigating systems  
- Extracting clues or secrets  
- Understanding system states  

This challenge is a safe environment to practice those basics.

---

## Prerequisites
Before attempting this challenge, you should be familiar with:

- Navigating directories in a terminal (`cd`, `ls`)  
- Basic file operations in Unix/Linux  
- How to use the `cat` command to display file content

If you‚Äôre new, don‚Äôt worry! We‚Äôll walk through the steps.

---

## Tools Required
- Access to a terminal or command line interface (Linux/macOS terminal, Windows WSL, or any Unix shell)  
- Basic Linux commands like `ls`, `cat`

---

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Explore the challenge folder
First, open your terminal and navigate to the `Obedient Cat` challenge directory.

Use this command to list the files:

```bash
ls -la
````

This will show all files, including hidden ones, along with permissions and file details.

### Step 2: Identify the file to read

Look for files that seem relevant ‚Äî usually text files or files with readable content. It might be named something like `flag.txt` or `readme.txt`.

### Step 3: Use `cat` to display file contents

Once you find the target file, use the `cat` command to read its contents:

```bash
cat flag.txt
```

This prints the entire file content to your terminal.

### Step 4: Locate the flag

Inside the file, look for a string formatted like `picoCTF{...}` ‚Äî this is the flag you need to submit.

## Explanation of Commands

* `ls -la`
  Lists all files with detailed info, including hidden files (those starting with a dot).

* `cat filename`
  Displays the content of the file named `filename` directly in the terminal.

---

## Additional Tips

* If the file content is too long, you can use `less filename` to scroll through it page by page.
* If you want to view only the first few lines, use `head filename`.
* For viewing the last lines, use `tail filename`.

## Flag

```
picoCTF{c47_15_0b3d13n7}
```

---

## Summary

The Obedient Cat challenge helps build a strong foundation in basic Linux commands to view files ‚Äî an essential first step in many cybersecurity investigations and CTFs. Mastering these commands will help you explore file systems confidently and find hidden clues quickly.
