Perfect! I’ll add a **Folder Structure** section to the main README, right after the repo overview, so visitors get a clear map of how everything’s organized.

Here’s the updated main README draft with a Folder Structure section included:

## What are CTFs? 🕵️‍♂️

Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are cybersecurity challenges designed to teach and test various skills such as cryptography, web exploitation, reverse engineering, forensics, and more. Participants solve puzzles to find “flags” — secret strings proving they completed the challenge.

picoCTF is a beginner-friendly CTF platform created by Carnegie Mellon University that provides a safe space for learners to practice these skills.
